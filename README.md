# Music-Led-Piano
A simple piano made out of push buttons, leds and sound files
\nThis project imitates the sequence DO-RE-MI-FA-SOL-LA-SI-DO of on standard piano.
As the buttons are pressed, leds are also lighted up. I see this project as the prototype for some sort of toy.
I am not an expert programmer, so the code should not be difficult to understand and maybe intuitive to some extent.
This code should work on both Python 2 and Python 3.

The sound files I am using in this program come from here. https://freesound.org/people/Jaz_the_MAN_2/
They are from Jaz_the_MAN_2. Unfortunetaly, the sound file for the sound "SI" is wrong and I couldn't find those samples anywhere else.
